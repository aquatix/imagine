imagine (or imagine-core)
=========================

Image catalog: make archives of photographs more accessible.

This is the core part, containing the models. The [crawler/updater](https://github.com/aquatix/imagine-crawler),
[web frontend/gallery](https://github.com/aquatix/imagine-web) and more projects will depend on it.


## Why an image archiver?

As a (hobby) photographer, you might have years and many gigabytes of material
on your drives which you only rarely watch back. To make it more easy to find
certain pictures or just provide a fun trip down memory lane, use imagine to
make an overview of your archives.

The goal is not to import the images into a (new) archive and manage collections
from there, but to provide an easy-to-use overview of your work. This can even
be used standalone (think on a different machine with no access to your library).
